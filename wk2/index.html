    <h1>ANCH flower genotypes</h1>
    <p>I'll just use part of a guide I made for breeding blue roses in Animal Crossing as the example.
      It was inspired by a guide graphic that I found errors in, linked <a href="https://elkpon.tumblr.com/post/615697465987006464/heres-my-complete-blue-rose-guide-for-acnh">here. </a></p>

    <p>Roses have 4 pairs of genes, each with 2 variants. Genotype is represented by binary,
       with 0 and 1 as the options for each; but most guides shorten it to ternary(?).
       With that, a single value represents a gene pair, where the number = how many '1's are in the pair. ex:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>00-00-01-00 becomes 0-0-1-0. </li>
      <li> 11-11-11-00 becomes 2-2-2-0.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Seed flowers</h1>
    <p>Seed flowers always have a set genotype, so it’s best to start from them to have some
      control over what you’re doing.
      Island flowers or ones you’ve hybridized could have way different genotypes.</p>
    <h2>Seed genotypes:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seed Reds:</strong> 2-0-0-1</li>
      <li><strong>Seed Whites:</strong> 0-0-1-0</li>
      <li><strong>Seed Yellows:</strong> 0-2-0-0</li>
    </ul>
